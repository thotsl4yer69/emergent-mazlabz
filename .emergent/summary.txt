The previous AI engineer began by discovering the project setup differed from the initial prompt, being a Vite-based React frontend instead of the expected FastAPI/MongoDB full-stack. After confirming the existing terminal-style UI's features, the user requested enhancing advanced terminal features, specifically a mobile-friendly document upload command. The AI engineer then implemented  and  commands, creating a new  component and extensively modifying  for state management and command parsing. This process involved iterative debugging to resolve syntax errors and code duplication. While the new features were successfully implemented and demonstrated, the current task ended with a Blocked request error originating from Vite's  configuration when accessed via a preview URL. The AI engineer is now poised to address this  issue.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to rebuild and enhance the MAZLABZ website. The existing application is a sophisticated terminal-style interface featuring company information, Stripe payment integration, a lead capture system, an ROI calculator, professional branding, and mobile responsiveness.

The key new feature explicitly requested by the user is a mobile-friendly document upload capability. This requires:
- A new  terminal command to open a modal allowing users to select recent documents (last 10 of , , , , , ,  file types) from their mobile device's files.
- The command should trigger browser permissions for file access.
- A complementary  terminal command to view a list of documents that have been uploaded.
- The implementation must seamlessly integrate with the existing professional terminal aesthetic.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server.
- **Browser File API**: Utilized for native file system interactions and access.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Method for converting binary file data into a string format for in-session storage.
- **State Management**: React's  for managing application data and UI state.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a single-page React frontend, built with Vite. It does not currently feature a separate FastAPI backend or MongoDB database, contrary to the initial system prompt's description.



- ****: This is the central component of the application, responsible for managing the terminal's state, processing user commands, and orchestrating the display of various features. It maintains , , , and the new  states. Extensive modifications were made to integrate the  and  commands into the terminal's command dictionary, including  and  functions, and to render the  component. The file also underwent several fixes for syntax errors and duplicated code during the implementation process.
- ****: This is a newly created React functional component dedicated to the document upload feature. It provides the mobile-optimized user interface for file selection, handles the native file input element, filters for supported document types, and displays Enterprise security badges. It takes  and  props to manage communication and state changes with its parent component, .
- ****: This stylesheet contains the custom CSS rules applied to various components within the application. It was updated to include specific styles that ensure the  component visually aligns with the existing professional terminal aesthetic of the MAZLABZ website.
- ****: This file configures the Vite development server and build process. It defines the host, port, and includes . This file is currently critical as the application is failing to load on a preview URL due to a Blocked request error, indicating that the  configuration needs to be explicitly updated to permit the preview host.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implementing other proposed interactive elements and advanced terminal features like auto-complete, real-time system monitoring, matrix-style background effects, terminal games, or natural language processing for commands, as these were not chosen by the user in favor of document upload.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current focus revolves around enhancing the MAZLABZ website with advanced terminal features, specifically a mobile-friendly document upload system. The AI engineer has successfully:
1.  **Integrated New Commands**: Two new terminal commands,  and , have been added to the application. The  command, when typed, triggers a mobile-optimized modal for users to select documents from their device, while the  command displays a list of currently uploaded documents. These commands are also reflected in the GNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.

A star (*) next to a name means that the command is disabled.

2.  **Developed  Component**: A dedicated React component, , was created to manage the entire document upload process. This includes handling the native file input, ensuring mobile-first design, supporting various document types (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX), prompting for browser permissions, and displaying Enterprise security badges for professional branding.
3.  **Modified **: The main  file was extensively updated to incorporate the new features. This involved:
    *   Adding state management () to track documents within the terminal session.
    *   Implementing the logic for the  and  commands.
    *   Integrating the  component into the terminal's rendering flow.
    *   Addressing and fixing several syntax errors and duplicated code sections that arose during the implementation process.
4.  **Base64 Encoding**: Uploaded files are processed and stored using Base64 encoding, as specified in the system prompt.

The core functionality of the new  and  commands has been successfully implemented and visually verified through screenshots. However, the application is currently encountering a Blocked request error when attempting to access it via a preview URL. This error message explicitly directs to the  configuration within , indicating that the preview host needs to be explicitly permitted. The AI engineer is in the process of addressing this configuration issue to ensure the application is accessible in the preview environment.

<optional_next_step>
Modify  to explicitly allow the preview host mentioned in the error message.
