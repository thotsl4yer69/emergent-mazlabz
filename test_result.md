# Test Results and Protocol

## Original User Problem Statement
User requested enhancing the MAZLABZ website terminal interface with an automated document upload feature. Key requirements:
- Automated upload command using File System Access API
- Backend server to store uploaded files for user access
- Focus on images and documents from downloads folder
- 10MB file size limit
- Minimal user interaction after one-time permission

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend-only React application successfully migrated to frontend/backend architecture
- ✅ FastAPI backend server created with file upload functionality
- ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:8001 with MongoDB integration
- ✅ All backend endpoints tested and working: /api/health, /api/upload, /api/files, /api/dashboard, /api/files/{id}
- ✅ File upload system supports images, documents, spreadsheets, presentations
- ✅ 10MB file size limit enforced
- ✅ File type validation working correctly
- ✅ MongoDB storing file metadata correctly
- ✅ Files stored in /app/backend/uploads with UUID naming
- ✅ Dashboard endpoint for admin access to all uploaded files
- ⏳ Next: Need to update frontend to use File System Access API for automated uploads

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent for all backend testing
- Test after each major backend change
- Always test API endpoints before frontend integration
- Verify file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
- ONLY test frontend with explicit user permission
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for comprehensive UI testing
- Test File System Access API permissions and functionality
- Verify terminal command integration

### Communication Protocol
- Always ask user before frontend testing
- Update this file after each testing cycle
- Document any issues found and resolutions applied

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User wants automated upload with minimal interaction
- Backend storage required for user access to files
- Dashboard access needed for uploaded files
- Focus on images and downloads folder content

## Backend Testing Results (2025-07-14)

### Test Summary
**All backend API endpoints tested successfully - 100% pass rate (12/12 tests)**

### Tested Endpoints:
1. **✅ Health Check (GET /api/health)**: Server and database connectivity verified
2. **✅ File Upload (POST /api/upload)**: Multiple file types uploaded successfully
3. **✅ File Listing (GET /api/files)**: File metadata retrieval working correctly
4. **✅ Dashboard (GET /api/dashboard)**: Admin dashboard data properly aggregated
5. **✅ File Download (GET /api/files/{file_id})**: File download functionality working
6. **✅ Root Endpoint (GET /)**: API information endpoint responding correctly

### Validation Tests Passed:
- ✅ Invalid file type rejection (.exe files blocked)
- ✅ File size limit enforcement (>10MB files rejected)
- ✅ File metadata structure validation
- ✅ Database persistence verification
- ✅ Error handling for non-existent files (404 responses)

### Technical Verification:
- **Database**: MongoDB connection healthy, file metadata properly stored
- **File Storage**: Files correctly saved to /app/backend/uploads/ with UUID naming
- **API Responses**: All endpoints return proper JSON responses with correct HTTP status codes
- **File Types Supported**: Images (.jpg), Documents (.pdf), Text files (.txt) all working
- **Security**: File type validation and size limits properly enforced

### Backend Status: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** ✅

The FastAPI backend server is working perfectly with all core functionality implemented and tested. Ready for frontend integration.
