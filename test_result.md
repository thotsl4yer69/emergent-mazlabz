# Test Results and Protocol

## Original User Problem Statement
User requested enhancing the MAZLABZ website terminal interface with an automated document upload feature. Key requirements:
- Automated upload command using File System Access API
- Backend server to store uploaded files for user access
- Focus on images and documents from downloads folder
- 10MB file size limit
- Minimal user interaction after one-time permission

## Current Status
- Frontend-only React application with terminal interface
- Document upload functionality partially implemented
- Current blocking issue: "Blocked request" error in vite.config.js
- Need to create FastAPI backend for file storage and dashboard access

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent for all backend testing
- Test after each major backend change
- Always test API endpoints before frontend integration
- Verify file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
- ONLY test frontend with explicit user permission
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for comprehensive UI testing
- Test File System Access API permissions and functionality
- Verify terminal command integration

### Communication Protocol
- Always ask user before frontend testing
- Update this file after each testing cycle
- Document any issues found and resolutions applied

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User wants automated upload with minimal interaction
- Backend storage required for user access to files
- Dashboard access needed for uploaded files
- Focus on images and downloads folder content
